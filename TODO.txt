 TO DO
=======

XML-to-Dict
===========

My XML-to-Dict code isn't recursive so it doesn't convert child nodes.
This means we lose invoice-items from invoice objects. Bad.

Timeslips
=========

How can we find out if a timeslip is 'billable' or not?


Invoices
========

Invoices has the basic info including total bill, but under it is an
itemization of billed items including Services, Hours, Expenses, etc.
For our purposes of allocating income based on hours worked, we don't
want to include Expenses.

Data by Project
===============

We can get a list of all Projects, then for each can ask for:

* /projects/projid/invoices 
* /projects/projid/timeslips

Unfortunately, we can NOT ask for project timeslips or invoices within
a date range, just since the dawn of time.

That might make a non-spreadsheet breakdown easier:
* walk each project
* tally timeslip hours by person
* tally invoices, excluding rebilled items
* report split of invoice by hours

Problem: the above is not date-restricted.

Dates
=====

Use python datetime objects instead of strings, even though we have to
pass strings for URL query arguments.
